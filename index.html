    <p>Hello my name is Preston Grissom. My nick name is Bear because I am a big dude who happens to have a big beard.
       My major right now is Enlglish. I plan on going into teaching once I am close to finishing graduating. I have gone through
    several ideas on what to do as a career and teaching sounds right. I enjoy video games and books. I am always deep into one or the other.
Just finished reading Jurassic Park. Playing several games at once. Bayonetta and a game called Titan Quest at the moment.
  I am married to my beautiful wife for little over 6 months. We got married in Febuary and took a honeymoon in Ohau, Hawaii. </p>
  <p>Currently my work takes me to Gamestop Key Holder and part time Security at an arena. I have enjoyed both of these jobs.
    They have a good amount of downtime and allow for me to read or play games occasionally. I plan on pursuing teaching requirements closer to my
    graduation. I believe skills can always benefit you even if they seem out of your general scope. Learning new things is always
    something i strive to do. I love finding new and intriquing things. Especially things I may be able to use in the future.
  </p>

    I have been a Member of the Church my whole life. I served a Full time mission in the State of Montana. I loved the 
    experiance and have learned many lessons from it. I continue to use these lessons in my day to day life. I am also 
    excited to learn more about the rest of you.
